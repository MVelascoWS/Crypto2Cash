## Problem
Accepting crypto as a payment method currently has two major flaws: off-ramping into fiat is complex and usually not offered by crypto companies and as someone crypto-native,
you don't know who takes your crypto. 

While crypto companies have focused on enabling the reception of crypto, the reality shows that vendors use their income off-chain. This service is not provided by existing
crypto sales points creating a more complex user experience that reduces the adoption of crypto as a payment method. 

## Solution
Crypto2Cash optimizes the user experience making it easier for micro-businesses to take payments. 

Crypto2Cash not only allows them to receive the funds from any crypto sale in Mexican pesos directly into their Mexican bank account after registering in the platform,
but it also gives them visibility within the Crypto2Cash app so that more use their crypto with them.
